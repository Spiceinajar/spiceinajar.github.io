Hello, I'm a hobbyist game and software developer. I have been programming in python for ~2 years, and have recently been learning other languages like HTML, rust, lua, java, javascript and others. I run a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Spiceinajar/videos) where I primarily make programming and CGI tutorials.

#### My published projects:
##### [Pearl](https://spiceinajar.itch.io/pearl)
A web texting app

##### [Space climb](https://spiceinajar.itch.io/space-climb)
A platformer video game in which the player jumps from randomly
placed objects and tries to get to the top
