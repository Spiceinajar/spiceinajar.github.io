Hello, I'm a hobbyist game and software developer. I have been programming in python for ~3 years, and have recently been learning other languages like HTML, rust, lua, java, javascript and others. I run a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Spiceinajar/videos) where I primarily make programming and CGI tutorials.
